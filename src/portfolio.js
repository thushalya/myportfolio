Our method utilizes dual contrastive learning to better distinguish between hate speech and non-hate speech, while emotion analysis helps capture the nuanced emotional context of tweets. Author profiling adds an additional layer by considering the user's historical behavior and tendencies, and transfer learning enables the model to adapt and improve its performance on various datasets. This comprehensive approach aims to significantly increase the accuracy and reliability of hate speech detection on Twitter.",
